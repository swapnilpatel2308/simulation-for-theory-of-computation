# simulation-for-theory-of-computation
this is a simulator for theory of computation machines algorithums

You just install this all files in your machine

then run App.py file

you get this type of interface

also this code is desing like any one can edit and add more functionality on it so take code and modify it and improve the efficiency of this software.
